Basic Google Map Functionality

This abstracts away some of the harder javascript in regards to Google Maps and provides a basic setup of using markers and lat/longs for a location.

Usage:

Include css/main.css in your page:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css"/>
```

Add Google Map API and build.min.js:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/dist/build.min.js"></script>
```
Add div for map to appear where you want:
```html
<div id="map-canvas"/>
```
Add your configuration (changing where applicable):
```html
<script>
// center map on the following lat/long
var centerLong = -104.716667;
var centerLat = 40.416667;

// add locations
var locations =  [

// add your locations here manually or from database/ajax call
// [ 'NAME OF PIN', Longitude, Latitude ]
['City Hall',  -104.695324, 40.422195],
['Greeley FunPlex', -104.787211, 40.428002 ]

];

// initialize map
google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', initialize(centerLong, centerLat , locations));

</script>
```
You now should have a working map with pins.
